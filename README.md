## About Me ##
My name is Micaela and I am a senior at the University of Florida and my major is Media Production. I am also doing a combined degree in Web Design and Online Communication.

## Past Coding Experience ##
I have taken a couple coding classes before in HTML, Java and C++. I would love to learn more about GitHub in this class though since I think a lot of programmers around the world use it.

## Career Goals ##
I would love to work as a freelance web developer because it would give me the freedom to choose my own schedule and work at my own pace.
